<!-- Linked List:    Singly Linked List
                Doubly Linked List
                Circular Linked List

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure, it consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the linked list. The next of the last node is null, indicating the end of the list. Linked Lists support efficient insertion and deletion operations -->

<!-- // Definition of a Node in a singly linked list
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    // Constructor to initialize the node with data
    public Node(int data)
    {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

Operations on Singly Linked List:
    Traversal
    Searching
    Length
    Insertion:
    Insert at the beginning
    Insert at the end
    Insert at a specific position
    Deletion:
    Delete from the beginning
    Delete from the end
    Delete a specific node -->
